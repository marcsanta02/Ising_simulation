# Ising Simulation

A Python implementation of the Ising model using the Metropolis algorithm to study ferromagnetic phase transitions.

## Features

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Models spin dynamics on a 2D lattice.
- **Critical Temperature Analysis**: Studies magnetization and energy near \(T_c\).
- **Visualizations**: Includes GIFs of lattice evolution over time and temperature.
- **Statistical Validation**: Compares results to theoretical predictions.

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy numba scienceplots jupyter
```

## Usage 

Clone the repository with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcsanta02/Ising_simulation.git
cd Ising_simulation
```
## Open the notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook Ising_MarcSantamaria_SaraFibla.ipynb
```
and run the jupyter notebook cells to run the simulation

## Results
- **Magnetization and Energy**
Plots of energy and magnetization vs. simulation steps at $T=2.0k_B$


- **Critical Temperature**
Sharp decrease in $\<m\>$ near $T_c=2.33k_B$
